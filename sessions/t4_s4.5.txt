SYMPOSIUM: Photomechanical and Electromechanical Behaviors in Ceramics, Semiconductors and Metals
ORGANIZERS: Qi An, Lin Li, Yu Zou, Xinghang Zhang
------------------------------

Photomechanical and electromechanical phenomena couple optical or electrical stimuli to a material’s mechanical response. Photomechanical materials produce stress and mechanical work when illuminated, while electromechanical coupling, e.g. piezoelectricity or current-induced deformation, links electric fields or currents to strain or plasticity. These couplings are increasingly recognized as powerful mechanisms for tuning mechanical behavior in ceramics, semiconductors and metals. Recent discoveries reveal the breadth and significance of these effects. In ceramics and wide-bandgap semiconductors, illumination can dramatically alter mechanical behavior via carrier–defect interactions. For example, moderate blue/UV light has been shown to increase the elastic stiffness of ZnO by over 40%. Photoexcitation in ZnS suppresses dislocation glide and reduces plasticity, whereas n-type doping or applied bias can enhance dislocation motion. In metals, DC electric fields or currents are known to lower the flow stress and enhance ductility, known as the electroplastic effect. Collectively, these findings indicate that electric charges and light can fundamentally modify bonding, defect mobility, and elastic response in crystalline solids.

This symposium will highlight recent advances in understanding photomechanical and electromechanical behaviors in ceramics, semiconductors and metals. We invite contributions spanning experiment, theory, and computation that address how light and electric fields interact with microstructure and defects to change mechanical properties. Special emphasis will be placed on fundamental mechanisms, such as charge-driven dislocation dynamics, strain-modulated band structure, light/field-driven phase transformations, as well as emerging techniques (e.g. in situ optical nanoindentation, ultrafast strain probes, multiscale modeling and machine learning). Topics include both basic science and the development of new opto-electro-mechanical materials and devices, aiming to advance the field of ceramics, semiconductors and metal that exploit opto-electro-mechanical coupling.

The topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:
•	Photoplasticity and photoelasticity in ceramics and inorganic semiconductors: light-induced changes in strength, ductility, and elastic moduli mediated by carriers and defects.
•	Electroplasticity and electromechanical coupling: electric-field or current-driven plastic deformation in metals and piezoelectric/flexoelectric responses in semiconductors and ceramics.
•	Mechanical behavior and defects in ceramics: Fundamental and applied studies on the mechanical response of ceramics, including elasticity, plasticity, fracture, creep, and fatigue under mechanical, thermal, electrical, or optical stimuli. Emphasis on the role of point defects, dislocations, grain boundaries, amorphization, and interfaces in governing deformation mechanisms, damage evolution, and reliability.
•	Piezotronic and piezo-phototronic phenomena: coupling between piezoelectric strain, carrier transport, and photonic excitation in non-centrosymmetric ceramics.
•	Characterization techniques: in situ optical/mechanical testing (e.g. photoindentation, light-modulated AFM), time-resolved optical and X-ray probes of photo/electro-mechanics, and advanced microscopy under bias or illumination.
•	Modeling and theory: first-principles and atomistic simulation of photoelectromechanical effects, phase-field or continuum models for coupled stimuli, and machine-learning approaches to predict opto-electro-mechanical behavior.
•	Design of multifunctional materials and devices: light- or field-actuated metamaterials, composites, and heterostructures that exploit photomechanical/electromechanical coupling, as well as novel material synthesis and processing for enhanced optomechanical performance.
