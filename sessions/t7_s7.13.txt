SYMPOSIUM: Dynamics and Control of Novel Infrastructural Systems
ORGANIZERS: Arun Prakash , James Gibert , Shirley J. Dyke
------------------------------

With the growing pressure on energy, materials, space and other resources, the need for low-cost, energy-efficient, sustainable and resilient infrastructural systems has never been greater. Dynamics and control play an especially important role in the performance of these systems towards achieving these goals.
This mini-symposium invites talks that contribute to advancements in these areas, including (but not limited to):
o	Design and control of mechanical and structural systems 
o	Cyber-physical systems
o	Smart and autonomous systems
o	Sensing and monitoring of infrastructure 
o	Retrofit and upgrade of existing infrastructure
o	Novel numerical / experimental techniques for the above
