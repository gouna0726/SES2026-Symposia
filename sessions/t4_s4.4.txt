SYMPOSIUM: Controlling Mechanical Waves with Metamaterials
ORGANIZERS: Charles Dorn, Ramathasan Thevamaran, Serife Tol, Vinod Ramakrishnan, Junfei Li
------------------------------

The focus of this symposium, in its 8th year at SES, is on the control of mechanical waves and vibrations using phononic crystals and metamaterials—advanced synthetic materials that are deliberately designed with specific geometry and constituent materials to provide a desired bulk functionality. The topics covered will include acoustic and ultrasonic bandgap materials, wave guides and filters, nonlinear dynamic metamaterials and structures, instability-induced switching behavior, non-reciprocal and directional wave transport, non-Hermitian and Parity-Time symmetric metamaterials, and topological metamaterials. Submissions focusing on the control of mechanical waves using multi-physics couplings such as electro- and magneto-mechanical couplings and chemically induced transformations are also encouraged. Additionally, contributions targeting emerging applications such as mechanical computing and flow control via fluid-metamaterial interaction are welcome. The symposium will bring together experimental, theoretical, and computational research in this emerging area to articulate new ideas and collaborations. We aim to provide a platform that enables the participants to advance current understanding of the control of mechanical waves and vibrations by manipulating the underlying structural features and their organization into a metamaterial in a well-informed and predictable manner.
