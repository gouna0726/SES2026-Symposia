SYMPOSIUM: Composites R&D and Education Using Generative AI and LLM
ORGANIZERS: Wenbin Yu, Dianyun Zhang
------------------------------

Composites R&D is entering a transformative era as generative AI and large language models (LLMs) begin to reshape how we design, analyze, manufacture, certify, and teach composite structures and materials. This symposium on “AI-Powered Composites R&D and Education” brings together researchers, practitioners, software developers, and educators who are leveraging these emerging tools to accelerate innovation, democratize expertise, and rethink traditional workflows across the composites value chain.

The symposium will highlight how LLMs, multimodal models, and agentic AI systems can augment or couple with physics-based methods—such as micromechanics, multiscale modeling, progressive damage, and structural optimization—to generate smarter design spaces, automate routine tasks, and support high-quality decision-making. Topics of interest include AI-assisted material and layup selection, generative design of laminates and architected materials, automated pre- and post-processing for FEA, intelligent workflows for certification-by-analysis, and integration of AI with digital twins for real-time monitoring and life prediction of composite components.

A key focus of the symposium is knowledge engineering for composites. We invite contributions on building domain-specific knowledge graphs, RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) systems, and specialized copilots that consolidate the fragmented knowledge of design guidelines, standards, best practices, failure databases, and historical test programs. Of particular interest are approaches that embed mechanics-based constraints into AI systems, ensure traceability of reasoning and sources, and support robust verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification.

The symposium also emphasizes education and workforce development. Generative AI is rapidly changing how students learn design, analysis, manufacturing, and testing of composites as well as how they document and communicate engineering decisions. We welcome case studies on AI-enabled learning modules, virtual teaching assistants, interactive design studios, and simulation-driven labs where LLMs guide students through problem framing, model setup, interpretation of results, and reflection on assumptions. Discussions on academic integrity, assessment strategies, and how to teach students to collaborate responsibly with AI tools are especially encouraged.

Submissions may address, but are not limited to: AI-augmented composites design and optimization; physics-informed and hybrid ML–mechanics workflows; automated code and script generation for composites software; natural-language interfaces to legacy tools; AI-assisted experimental planning and data reduction; interpretable and trustworthy AI for safety-critical structures; and frameworks for benchmarking and governing AI use in industrial and regulatory contexts. Contributions that include open-source tools, benchmark datasets, and reproducible workflows are particularly welcome.

In addition to technical presentations, the symposium aims to foster dialogue on standards, ethics, and future directions: What new skills will composite engineers need in an AI-rich environment? How do we ensure that generative models respect physical laws and domain constraints? What are effective patterns for human-in-the-loop oversight in design, analysis, and education? By bringing together diverse perspectives from academia, industry, and government, this symposium seeks to chart a practical roadmap for using generative AI and LLMs to make composites R&D and education more efficient, more accessible, and ultimately more impactful.
