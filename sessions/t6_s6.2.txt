SYMPOSIUM: Dynamics, instabilities, and singularities in free surface flows
ORGANIZERS: Osman Basaran, Hansol Wee, Ajay Kumar, Naresh Dhanwani
------------------------------

Free surface flows with hydrodynamic singularities are legion in science and engineering. Such hydrodynamic singularities arise in situations where liquid drops and jets, bubbles, and liquid films break or pinch-off or rupture, others where drops and bubbles coalesce or merge, when a liquid drop impacts a cold or a hot solid surface, and during thin film coating flows where there are dynamic or moving contact lines. Hydrodynamic singularities are challenging to study because they involve flows where the intrinsic time and length scales may differ by at least six or more orders of magnitude (Eggers, Rev. Mod. Phys., 1997; Eggers and Villermaux, Rep. Prog. Phys., 2008; Anthony et al., Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech., 2023). Free surface flows with singularities arise in applications as diverse as ink jet printing, drop-by-drop manufacturing, spraying and atomization (e.g. in crop spraying and spray coating and painting), chemical separations, and sintering. The goal of the mini symposium is to bring researchers from numerous disciplines (engineering, physics, and mathematics) to summarize the state-of-the art and help define possible avenues of future research in the field.
