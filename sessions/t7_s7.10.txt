SYMPOSIUM: Multimodal Scanning Probe Nano-Metrology via Contact and Non-Contact Mechanics
ORGANIZERS: SungWoo Nam, Mehmet Baykara
------------------------------

The rapid advancement of nanotechnology, quantum materials, and semiconductor manufacturing has amplified the need for robust, high-resolution metrology tools capable of probing electrical, mechanical, optical, and functional properties with unprecedented precision. This symposium aims to bring together researchers developing and applying multimodal atomic force microscopy (AFM)—including conductive AFM (C-AFM), friction force microscopy (FFM), piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), photo-induced force microscopy (PiFM), scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM), and related advanced AFM modalities—to highlight emerging capabilities and the foundational mechanics that govern their performance. A central theme of the symposium is the role of contact and non-contact mechanics, which fundamentally determine spatial resolution, signal sensitivity, and quantitative interpretation across AFM techniques. We invite contributions addressing theoretical, computational, and experimental advances that deepen our understanding of tip–sample interactions—from continuum and atomistic modeling of contact forces, adhesion, viscoelasticity, and electro-mechanical coupling, to the optical field that underpins PiFM, s-SNOM, and other near-field probes. The symposium will also showcase applications where multimodal AFM provides unique insights, including characterization of 2D materials and van der Waals heterostructures. Particular interest will be placed on correlative and hybrid approaches—such as integrating/combining electrical (C-AFM), mechanical (FFM), electro-mechanical (PFM), and/or nearfield optical spectroscopy —to extract multidimensional datasets that bridge nanoscale physics with device-level functionality. This symposium will foster cross-disciplinary dialogue aimed at connecting contact and non-contact mechanics communities with multimodal scanning probe microscopy communities to establish fundamentals and quantitative standards, improving reproducibility, and accelerating the adoption of next-generation nano-metrology platforms.

Topics will include:
1. Mechanics of tip–sample contact, near-contact, and non-contact interactions that dictate spatial resolution, force sensitivity, and signal formation across advanced AFM modes.
2. Quantitative multimodal metrology that integrates electrical, mechanical, and optical signals to extract reproducible, physics-based measurements of nanoscale interaction mechanisms.
3. Coupling between confined optical fields and tip–sample mechanics in near-field probes such as PiFM and s-SNOM, linking optical excitation to local electro-mechanical response.
4. Mechanics-informed multimodal AFM applied to emerging optoelectronic and 2D materials to resolve interfacial forces, polarization effects, and structure–property relationships.
