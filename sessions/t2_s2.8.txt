SYMPOSIUM: From Nerves to Nanomaterials: Mechanics of Super Soft Porous Materials
ORGANIZERS: Arina Korneva
------------------------------


This mini symposium will bring together scientists who are pioneering theoretical, experimental, computational, and imaging methods to discover the mechanics of super soft fluid-saturated porous materials. These materials encompass materials in invertebrates such as medusae, marine sponges, and the like; vertebrate nerves, brain, and cartilage, and in synthetic hydrogels and nanoporous materials. While these materials appear across nature and engineering, they exhibit similar emerging mechanical behaviors, which we’ve only scratched the surface of. This symposium will share new developments in mechanics of soft porous media and new ideas for pushing forward this emerging field.

Application 1: Porous soft biological materials. This symposium will bring together new ideas in mechanics to aid in understanding the roles of fluid in our nerves: the optic nerve responsible for vision, peripheral nerves responsible for sensing, and motor nerves responsible for movement. The status quo in nerves has been that fluid is needed for nutrient support and electrical signaling. A decade ago, a new role for fluid flow was discovered in the brain- to clear toxins during sleep. Engineering mechanics has been used to advance our understanding of this phenomenon in the brain and is now emerging for other nerves which have different micro- and nano-structures. Nerves are also complex materials because they are comprised of many different types of polymers, solutes, gases, ions, and fluids. Recently, engineering mechanics principles were used to propose that fluid can shield cells inside nerves from injury. In another group, engineering mechanics was used to model the change in fluid pressure in the nerve during various physiological conditions. However, the flow of fluid in the nano-pores and micro-pores in various nerves is a new topic with implications for broad applications in biology and medicine. 

Application 2: Natural and Engineered Soft Porous Nanomaterials. This symposium will serve as a platform to develop new ideas for studying poromechanics of innovative nanomaterials: nanofibrous membranes from synthetic nanofibers or biological fibers (i.e. actin), soft porous crystalline materials, Metal-Organic Frameworks. Nanofibrous membranes can swell to absorb various solvents or filter solutes. Newly engineered Metal-Organic Frameworks can change their structure or undergo phase transitions upon interaction with fluids, like many novel hydrogels. These emerging materials are actively studied by materials scientists and chemical engineers, but there is a lack of understanding their mechanical properties and the means to control their mechanical behavior in different environments. The goal of this symposium is to identify the common ground between the novel theoretical and computational models of these materials. As a bonus, these models will open up new avenues in modeling other soft materials.

Application 3: Advanced experimentation and imaging of fluid-solid interactions in porous materials. Experiments with super soft materials are extremely challenging, and sometimes their synthesis or isolation is limited to minuscule amounts. Furthermore, their complex behavior (swelling/deswelling, electric properties, solute transport, self-actuation of forces, etc.) does not have a defined methodology for characterization. The pore structure is between nano- to micron-scale, requiring the development of advanced image-based characterization techniques. This symposium will gather experts in the field and discuss new ideas for evaluating the emerging mechanics of these materials and structures. We will welcome experts in advanced optics, acoustics, X-ray imaging, MRI, and developers of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). These experts are invited to the mini-symposium to share novel techniques for discovering novel phenomena of soft porous materials.
