SYMPOSIUM: Instabilities and Nonlinear Mechanics Across Structural Scales
ORGANIZERS: Lucia Stein-Montalvo, Fani Derveni
------------------------------

Controllable instabilities and nonlinear deformations in slender and compliant structures offer powerful opportunities for engineering applications, ranging from stretchable electronics and surgical robotics devices to energy-absorbing, load-redistributing components and lightweight civil, architectural, and aerospace systems.
Despite their strong potential in the built environment and emerging frontiers such as large-scale deployable and adaptive structural systems, infrastructure resilience, and space structures, the majority of research in this area remains focused on millimeter- and centimeter-scale systems, where idealized behavior and controlled boundary conditions are often easier to achieve. 
Bridging these concepts across scales requires new mechanical insights that account for increased imperfection sensitivity, geometric and material nonlinearities, stochastic variability, multiphysics coupling, and scale-dependent load paths. Addressing these challenges demands a range of complementary approaches, including experiments, nonlinear theory, high-fidelity numerical simulations, reduced-order modeling, and data-driven methods.
The goal of this mini-symposium is to bring together researchers working on instabilities and nonlinear mechanics across length scales to identify unifying mechanical principles, share advances in scale-bridging methodologies, and foster cross-fertilization between communities studying small-scale systems and full-scale structural applications.

Topics of interest: 
Fundamental mechanics approaches (experimental, theoretical, numerical, and data-driven) to understanding and bridging scale effects in nonlinear and instability-driven systems
Stability and imperfection sensitivity of buckling-driven behavior in slender structures across scales 
Deployable, adaptive, and reconfigurable structures and structural systems grounded in mechanical instabilities
Stimuli-responsive and environmentally coupled mechanical systems, with emphasis on mechanics rather than material chemistry
Applications of instabilities and large, nonlinear deformations in the built environment, infrastructure, aerospace and space structures, and other large-scale engineering systems
