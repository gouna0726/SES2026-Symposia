The birth of the field of electrohydrodynamics (EHD) can be traced to the seminal papers by Lord Rayleigh (Phil. Mag., 1882) on the instability of charged drops and G. I. Taylor (Proc. Roy. Soc. London, 1964) on the instability of drops and formation of conical tips caused by an applied electric field. The field came to its own after Taylor (1966) and Melcher (1965/6) independently discovered the thereto unknown and hence unexpected role of electrical shear stresses in the dynamics of liquid drops and films, and Melcher and Taylor joined forces to publish their now celebrated review article on EHD that introduced the concept of a leaky dielectric or semi insulating fluid to the scientific community (Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech., 1969). While the field was initially purely driven by fundamental questions arising in physics and atmospheric sciences (especially cloud physics), both scientific challenges and new applications worked in tandem to generate further interest in the field. Since the 1970s, desalting, emulsification, and dehydration of crude oil by the application of an electric field and the use of electric fields in ink jet printing helped to further popularize the field. In 1992, J. B. Fenn of Yale University was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his discovery of using electric fields in the now widely used analytical technique known as electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (EIMS). Recent areas of intense research activity have included electrospinning and drop-by-drop processing. The significance of EHD to fluid mechanics is made evident by the publication roughly every ten years of an authoritative review article in the Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech. (e.g. Saville, 1997, and Vlahovska, 2019). Recent research in the field have been focused on various instabilities and breakup dynamics exhibited by prolate but more significantly by oblate drops, vesicles, and drop-drop interactions. Some challenges and unsolved problems in the field include theoretical analysis of situations where the leaky dielectric model is inadequate and the use of electric fields to create organized as well as disorganized structures far from equilibrium. The goal of the mini symposium is to bring researchers from numerous disciplines (engineering, physics, analytical chemistry, and mathematics) to summarize the state-of-the art and help define possible avenues of future theoretical, computational, and experimental research in the field.
