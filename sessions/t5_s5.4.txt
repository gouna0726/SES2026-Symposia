SYMPOSIUM: Complex rheology in polymeric materials and structures
ORGANIZERS: Jiawei Yang, Yue (Luna) Zheng, Abigail Plummer, Ahmed Ettaf Elbanna
------------------------------

Polymeric materials, including gels, elastomers, plastics, and, broadly, non-Newtonian fluids, are playing indispensable and profound roles in every aspect of modern society. Deformation and flow are basic characteristics of this class of material, coupling intrinsic material architectures, topologies, and structures with extrinsic time, rate, loading history, and environmental cues across multiple length scales, giving rise to an immensely rich material responsiveness and behaviors and an exciting and vibrant research field. This mini symposium serves as a platform to share recent experimental, computational, and theoretical advances in exploring and understanding the complex rheology of polymeric materials and their integrated structures, including but not limited to large deformation, viscoelasticity(plasticity), growth, fracture, fatigue, instability, multi-physics coupling, phase transition, and structure-property relationships. The fundamental understanding of complex rheology drives both material innovation and technological development. This mini symposium also brings together material scientists and mechanicians to engage in conversations and discussions, and forge collaborations to explore new opportunities and directions in this field.
