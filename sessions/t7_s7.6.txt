SYMPOSIUM: Mechanics in Sustainable Materials and Systems
ORGANIZERS: Christos Athanasiou, Xing Liu, Miguel Bessa, Lihua Jin, Vikas Srivastava
------------------------------

Mechanics serves as a cornerstone for the development of cutting-edge technologies and for advancing resource efficiency. From new recycling technologies to bio-degradable plastics, and from eco-friendly manufacturing to space structures, the field of mechanics provides fundamental theoretical, computational, and experimental frameworks that enable or improve those emerging fields.

This symposium brings together researchers from across the mechanics community to highlight recent advances and emerging directions in mechanics-driven sustainability. The goal is to showcase how fundamental mechanical principles can guide the development of transformative technologies that address pressing environmental and technological challenges on Earth and beyond.
