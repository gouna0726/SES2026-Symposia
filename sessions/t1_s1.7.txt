SYMPOSIUM: Structural Changes in Materials at Normal and Extreme Conditions: A Symposium in Honor of the 70th Birthday of Prof. Valery Levitas
ORGANIZERS: Ashraf Bastawros, Kasra Momeni <kmomeni@ua.edu> , Liming Xiong <lxiong3@ncsu.edu>
------------------------------

This symposium honors Prof. Valery Levitas’ seminal contributions to the mechanics and physics of structural changes in materials, spanning phase transformations, inelasticity, and coupled multi-physics phenomena across length and time scales. The session will bring together researchers working on fundamental mechanisms and predictive frameworks for structural evolution in solids, including (but not limited to) solid–solid and martensitic transformations, pressure- and stress-induced phase transitions, chemical reactions, amorphization, defect-mediated plasticity (dislocations, twinning), damage and failure, and microstructure/grain-structure evolution.

A central theme is the integration of mechanical, physical, and mathematical perspectives—linking atomistic mechanisms to mesoscale evolution and macroscale response—under both ambient and extreme conditions. Contributions are especially encouraged that leverage high-pressure/high-temperature platforms (e.g., diamond anvil cell experiments, large-volume press, shock/ramp compression) and in situ/operando characterization (e.g., synchrotron X-ray diffraction/imaging, spectroscopy, electron microscopy) to resolve transformation pathways and kinetics. We also welcome emerging data-driven approaches, including high-throughput experimentation and simulation, materials informatics, machine-learning-assisted constitutive modeling, physics-informed ML, uncertainty quantification, and data assimilation/digital twins that accelerate discovery and improve predictive capability.

Experimental, analytical, computational, and hybrid (physics + data) studies, as well as applications to materials under severe deformation or extreme environments, are all within scope.
