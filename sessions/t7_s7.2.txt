SYMPOSIUM: Physics-Informed and Data-Driven Approaches to Coupled Multiphysics
ORGANIZERS: Xingchi Yan, Siyuan Song
------------------------------

Coupled physical systems—such as chemo-mechanical functional materials, opto-acoustic media, soft and biological matter — often exhibit strongly nonlinear and nonlocal behavior that is difficult to measure directly or infer from experiments. This section highlights emerging physics-informed, inverse, and data-driven approaches approaches for identifying, interpreting, and predicting mechanical behavior in such systems. 

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: inverse problems in solid and fluid mechanics; reaction- and field-induced stresses; photoacoustic phenomena; constitutive inference in nonlinear and soft materials and the integration of machine learning with mechanistic models. Contributions combining advanced experiments (e.g., photoacoustics, electrochemical measurements, advanced microscopy), theoretical modeling, and data-driven inference are especially encouraged.

By bringing together researchers working on functional materials, soft matter, and emerging measurement platforms, this section aims to highlight new paradigms in mechanics where inference, learning, and multiphysics coupling play a central role.
