SYMPOSIUM: AI Powered Inverse Design for Next Generation Composites
ORGANIZERS: Srikanth Pilla, Gang Li
------------------------------

Composites are rapidly expanding into high-rate, high-performance applications, but development cycles are still slowed by trial-and-error across materials selection, processing windows, tooling, and part validation. This symposium focuses on how a revolutionary inverse design platform can accelerate fiber reinforced polymer composites by connecting performance targets to material architectures and manufacturing pathways, linking data, physics-based simulation, and AI and ML to enable faster, more reliable design-to-manufacture decisions.

We invite contributions that demonstrate workflows spanning material process microstructure performance relationships, multi-fidelity modeling, and validation across scalable manufacturing routes, particularly injection molding, thermoforming, and additive manufacturing. Emphasis will be placed on process-aware part design and optimization to improve quality, dimensional stability, mechanical performance, manufacturability, and sustainability through recyclability, waste reduction, and energy efficiency.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
I.	AI/ML-enabled inverse design approaches for composites
II.	AI/ML for injection molding of composites 
III.	AI/ML-guided thermoforming and stamp forming
IV.	AI/ML-driven additive manufacturing of composites
V.	AI/ML-driven resin transfer molding of composites
VI.	Process modeling for Composites with AI/ML surrogates 

This symposium brings together researchers and practitioners to share methods, benchmarks, and manufacturing case studies that advance composites development, increase confidence, and enable scalable production through inverse design.
