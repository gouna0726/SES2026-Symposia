SYMPOSIUM: Young Faculty Assembly
ORGANIZERS: Xiaojia Shelly Zhang, Yong Zhu, Kejie Zhao
------------------------------

This symposium aims to create a space for SES attendees to convene, network, and learn about career development options and advice, work-life balance, and mentoring for early-career faculty members. Senior researchers in the community will serve as mentors in the event. By gathering both junior and senior researchers in the field, we also aim to foster the creation of mentorship relations through this event.
