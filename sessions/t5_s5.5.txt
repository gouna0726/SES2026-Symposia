SYMPOSIUM: Mechanics of Failure in Network Materials
ORGANIZERS: Chase Hartquist, Junsoo Kim, Bolei Deng, Shaoting Lin
------------------------------

Description: 
Networked architectures underpin the mechanical failure response of a vast array of materials, ranging from polymer gels, elastomers, and fibrous tissues to metamaterials and composites. In soft and polymeric systems, molecular connectivity, mesoscale topology, and heterogeneity lead to rich nonlinear failure behaviors when networks are subjected to large deformations, cyclic loads, or interfacial stresses. This mini-symposium highlights recent advances in the mechanics of fracture, failure, and degradation in network materials broadly, with a particular emphasis on polymers and soft matter. A key theme is to connect architecture, topology, constituent mechanics, and heterogeneity with macroscopic failure properties and leverage these insights towards multiscale design of tough and fatigue-resistant network materials. Experimental, theoretical, and computational studies that uncover multiscale failure mechanisms or inform the rational design of robust network architectures are highly encouraged.
