------------------------------

Soft electrochemically active materials—such as organic mixed ionic–electronic conductors (OMIECs), radical polymers, redox-active hydrogels, and electrochemically active polymer composites—offer a rare combination of electrochemical functionality and mechanical compliance. This combination underpins emerging technologies including stretchable and wearable electronics, bioelectronic interfaces, organic electrochemical devices and transistors, soft robotics and actuators, and mechanically conformable energy-storage systems. 

In these platforms, mechanics is not merely a reliability constraint; it actively governs transport pathways, morphological stability, and interfacial integrity, thereby shaping device performance, failure modes, and lifetime. For example, repeated ion/solvent insertion and extraction drives cyclic swelling and stress evolution that can produce fatigue; in film–substrate architectures, swelling-induced strain mismatch can trigger film cracking and delamination; and in stretchable systems, sustained deformation can cause creep and stress relaxation that translate into performance drift.

A central challenge is that electrochemical transport, electrostatic interactions, phase/morphology evolution, and mechanical response are strongly coupled across molecular-to-device length scales and nanoseconds-to-hours timescales, while the effective mechanical properties evolve dynamically during operation. Resolving this coupled, time-evolving chemo–electro–mechanical response is essential to (i) establish mechanistic understanding of degradation and failure, (ii) construct predictive, design-relevant constitutive and reduced-order models, and (iii) guide mechanics-oriented material, device, and interface design. Progress increasingly depends on in-situ/operando multimodal characterization (imaging, scattering/spectroscopy, electrochemical diagnostics, and mechanical measurements), multiscale modeling, and AI/ML methods for multimodal data fusion, inverse parameter identification, and accelerated simulation/design.

This symposium will bring together researchers spanning mechanics of materials theory, characterization, device physics, and computational modeling to discuss emerging understanding and open problems in the mechanics and dynamics of soft electrochemically active materials, with emphasis on AI/ML as a unifying toolkit. Topics include operando mechanical characterization; chemo–electro–mechanical coupling and interfacial mechanics; multiscale and reduced-order modeling; mechanics in applications including soft robotics, optoelectronics, and organic electrochemical transistors; and AI-guided design of materials, interfaces, and devices with uncertainty-aware prediction. By fostering interdisciplinary dialogue, the symposium aims to advance fundamental understanding and accelerate the development of mechanically robust soft electrochemically active materials and systems for next-generation applications.
